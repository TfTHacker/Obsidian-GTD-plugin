## Obsidian gets things done!

OTD - The extension for GTD practitioners.
Based on [larslockefeer/obsidian-plugin-todo](https://github.com/larslockefeer/obsidian-plugin-todo)

### Features
- Everything customizable. Date formats, tags, view visibility
- Exclusions based on folder (e.g. Templated folder), based on filename (e.g. Holiday checklist.md; Publish Checklist.md; etc), based on TODO content (e.g. #exclude tag)
- Aggregates all outstanding TODOs in your vault and lists them in a single view
- Split out TODOs by type ("Inbox", "Overdue", "Today", "Scheduled", "Context Actions, and "Someday/Maybe")
- Schedule a TODO for a specific date by adding a tag #YYYY/DD/MM
- Mark a TODO as Someday/Maybe by adding a tag #someday
- Create a Context Action TODO by adding a Context such as a person, project or location, plus adding an action tag (e.g. #discussWith, #waitingFor, #promisedTo)
- Complete TODOs from the list view
- Quickly jump to the file in which a TODO is found from the list view
- Filter TODOs based on Context. Default setting assumes [[Pepole/Name]], [[Projects/Name]], [[Locations/Name]] naming convention for projects, people and locations.

### Views
- Unclassified TODOs show up in the Inbox. A TODO is unclassified if it does not meet any of these criteria: has a date, or has both a Context and an Action, or has a Someday/Maybe tag.
- TODOs with a date show up in Overdue, Today, and Scheduled as meaningful
- TODOs that have both a Context and an Action show up in Context Actions
- TODOs with the Someday tag show up in the Someday/maybe view
